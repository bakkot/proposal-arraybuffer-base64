# ArrayBuffer to/from base64

base64 is the de-facto standard way to represent arbitrary binary data as ASCII. JavaScript has ArrayBuffers (and other wrapping types) to work with binary data, but no built-in mechanism to encode that data as base64, nor to take base64'd data and produce a corresponding ArrayBuffer. We should fix that.

See [initial spec text](https://bakkot.github.io/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i7_ajP8J1EjILjBoYYkE2nmCT429-LuD7kJyhRUdXqY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Possible API

```js
let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(42);
// populate buffer here
console.log(buffer.toBase64());
```

and

```js
let buffer = ArrayBuffer.fromBase64('AQMDBw=='); // returns a new length-4 ArrayBuffer
```

That is, I propose to add `ArrayBuffer.prototype.toBase64` and `ArrayBuffer.fromBase64` methods. The latter would throw if given a string which is not properly base64 encoded.

## Questions

### What about SharedArrayBuffers?

Yeah, probably we should add these methods there also. I'm not certain whether they should be specified to be atomic.

### Should these be asynchronous?

In practice most base64'd data I encounter is on the order of hundreds of bytes (e.g. SSH keys), which can be encoded and decoded extremely quickly. It would be a shame to require Promises to deal with such data, I think, especially given that the alternatives people currently use all appear to be synchronous.

Possibly we should have asynchronous versions for working with large data.

### Why not just use `atob` and `btoa`?

Those methods are take and consume strings, rather than translating between a string and an ArrayBuffer.

### Why not TextEncoder?

base64 is not a text encoding format; there's no [code points](https://unicode.org/glossary/#code_point) involved. So despite fitting with the type signature of TextEncoder/TextDecoder, base64 encoding and decoding is not a conceptually appropriate thing for those APIs to do.

That's also been the consensus when it's come up [previously](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/base64-with-textencoder-textdecoder/1307/2).

### But _which_ base64?

An excellent question. Unfortunately, I think we're probably stuck with using the thing called "base64" in [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4) as the default; that is, using `+` and `/` to represent 62 and 63, and mandatory padding with `=`. I don't think these are good choices, but interop requires they be the default.

We could potentially add an options bag argument allowing these details to be configured, as in

```js
buffer.toBase64({ variant: 'base64url', padding: false });

ArrayBuffer.fromBase64('_w', { variant: 'base64url', padding: false });
```

### What if I just want to encode a portion of an ArrayBuffer, or to decode a Base64 string into an existing ArrayBuffer?

While those are reasonable things to want, I think they need not be included in the initial version of this API. We can add them later if demand proves high. Until then, copying slices of memory is quite fast.
